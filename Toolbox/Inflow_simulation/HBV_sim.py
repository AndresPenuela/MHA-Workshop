     Comments:
     * The Capillary flux (from upper tank to soil moisture accounting module)
     is not considered
     * The recharge from the soil to the upper zone is considered to be a
     faster process than evapotranspiration.
     * The preferential path from the upper zone can be modified 
               - Case 1: interflow is dominant
               - Case 2: percolation is dominant
